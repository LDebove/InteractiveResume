                The company relied on a fragmented and manual system for
                managing incoming emails and task assignments, using separate
                tools for logging messages in Excel, drafting responses in
                Word, and tracking progress across disconnected files. This
                approach led to duplicated efforts, version conflicts, and
                frequent oversights, such as unanswered emails or overlapping
                task assignments. The lack of a centralized platform made it
                difficult for managers to monitor workloads or ensure timely
                follow-ups, resulting in operational delays and reduced team
                coordination.

                As email volume grew and more employees were involved in
                handling customer communications, the limitations of the
                existing process became increasingly apparent. The absence of
                real-time visibility into task statuses and assigned
                responsibilities created bottlenecks and miscommunication,
                particularly between factory and office teams.
                There was a clear and pressing need for an integrated,
                role-based system that could unify email management, task
                delegation, and progress tracking in a secure, scalable
                environment.

            <span>
                The goal was to replace these inefficient practices with a
                streamlined digital solution that would enhance collaboration,
                reduce manual overhead, and provide managers with actionable
                insights into team performance. By centralizing communications
                and tasks, the company aimed to improve responsiveness,
                minimize errors, and support more effective planning and
                resource allocation across departments.

        <app-story-project-outcome>
            <span>
                I architected and developed a full-stack web application using
                Angular for the dynamic frontend and a Python-based RESTful API
                for the backend, with a relational database for secure data
                storage. The platform integrates seamlessly with Gmail through
                the Google Workspace API, automatically syncing and
                categorizing incoming emails from company addresses. Users can
                convert emails into tasks, assign them to team members, add
                customer details, and track progress through an intuitive
                dashboard, all within a single interface.
            </span>
            <span>
                I implemented robust user authentication and role-based access
                controls to ensure data security and appropriate permissions
                for different team members. Advanced features such as email
                tagging, AI-assisted reply suggestions, and real-time task
                updates were incorporated to enhance productivity and reduce
                manual input. The system provides managers with a comprehensive
                overview of task distribution, statuses, and deadlines,
                enabling better workload management and timely interventions.
            </span>
            <span>
                The platform is fully functional and in active use,
                successfully replacing the previous disconnected tools. It has
                eliminated duplicate data entry, improved task visibility, and
                accelerated response times, contributing to more efficient team
                collaboration and customer communication. The centralized
                design ensures all users operate from a single source of truth,
                reducing errors and enhancing overall operational coherence.

                The manual process of searching through a catalog of over
                120,000 jewelry items was highly inefficient and
                time-consuming. Employees had to visually match
                customer-provided photos against printed or digital catalogs,
                a task that could take hours and was prone to human error. This
                lack of automation not only slowed down response times but also
                limited the company’s ability to efficiently handle growing
                customer requests for visual comparisons and product
                availability checks.
            </span>
            <span>
                As the volume and variety of jewelry designs increased, the
                existing system became increasingly unsustainable. The absence
                of a digital tool meant that employees spent valuable time on
                repetitive tasks like creating presentation slides manually,
                rather than focusing on higher-value customer interactions.
                This inefficiency also risked customer dissatisfaction due to
                delayed replies and potential mismatches, underscoring the
                urgent need for a modern, AI-powered solution to enhance
                accuracy and operational speed.
            </span>
            <span>
                The company recognized that an automated visual search system
                would not only save time but also improve consistency in
                identifying products. By implementing such a tool, the business
                aimed to reduce manual workload, minimize errors, and provide a
                more responsive and professional service to clients, ultimately
                supporting scalability and competitive advantage in a luxury
                market where precision and efficiency are critical.

            <span>
                I designed and developed a custom software application using
                Python and Google’s Vision AI Product Search to enable fast and
                accurate visual recognition of jewelry items from
                customer-submitted photos. The application processes images in
                real time, even when they include extraneous elements like
                hands or background objects, and returns matching catalog
                entries complete with serial numbers and product details. This
                automation drastically reduced search times from hours to
                seconds, allowing employees to respond to customer inquiries
                with greater speed and confidence.
            </span>
            <span>
                To further enhance usability, I integrated batch processing
                functionality, enabling the system to handle multiple image
                searches simultaneously. I implemented multithreading to manage
                concurrent AI requests efficiently, eliminating system freezes
                and ensuring smooth performance under high load. The
                application also features an automated report generation tool
                that compiles search results into formatted PowerPoint
                presentations, complete with images and serial numbers,
                streamlining the preparation of client proposals.
            </span>
            <span>
                The final deliverable was a stable, user-friendly desktop
                application deployed for daily use by the company’s sales and
                support teams. It has significantly improved workflow
                efficiency, reduced manual effort, and enhanced the accuracy of
                product identification. The tool continues to support the team
                in managing a growing catalog while maintaining high standards
                of customer service.
